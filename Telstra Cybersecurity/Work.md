Skills gained from completing a self-paced program on malware attack response:

- Incident triage and detection & response
- Network and data analysis
- Cybersecurity and security engineering
- Teamwork and communication
- Software development with Python
- Solution architecture and design thinking
- Problem-solving and root cause analysis
- Incident reflection and postmortem creation
- Strategy, governance, risk, and compliance

The program took approximately 2.5-3.5 hours to complete and provided hands-on experience in responding to a malware attack, analyzing the attack data, mitigating the malware, and creating an incident postmortem.
